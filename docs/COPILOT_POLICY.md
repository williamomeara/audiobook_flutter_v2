Copilot CLI usage policy

- Do NOT commit or push repository changes to remote unless explicitly requested by the user.
- The Copilot CLI will make edits locally and present exact diffs or file contents for user approval before committing.
- The Copilot CLI will ask for explicit permission before running git commit or git push operations.

If you want this policy committed and pushed to the remote repository, reply "commit and push" and I will proceed.
