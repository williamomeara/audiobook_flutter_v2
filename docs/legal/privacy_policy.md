## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Éist Audiobook Reader ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application ("App").

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Our App is designed to work primarily offline, and we collect minimal data.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **Books and Documents:** The App processes EPUB and PDF files you choose to import. These files are stored locally on your device and are never uploaded to our servers.

- **Preferences:** Your reading preferences (voice selection, playback speed, bookmarks, etc.) are stored locally on your device.

### Automatically Collected Information

- **Device Information:** We may collect basic device information (device type, operating system version) for crash reporting and app improvement purposes.

- **Usage Analytics:** We may collect anonymous usage statistics (features used, reading duration) to improve the App. This data is aggregated and cannot identify individual users.

### Purchase Information

- **Subscription Data:** If you purchase a premium subscription, payment is processed entirely through Google Play or Apple App Store. We receive confirmation of your subscription status but never receive or store your payment card details.

## How We Use Your Information

- **To Provide the Service:** Process your books with text-to-speech, save your reading progress, and provide playback controls.

- **To Improve the App:** Analyze anonymous usage patterns to fix bugs and improve features.
